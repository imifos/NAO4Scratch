NAO4Scratch - Scratch 2.0 Extension to command the NAO robot using Scratch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

History
-------
All started here: http://cfp.devoxx.fr/devoxxfr2014/talk/CLU-422/Hackaton%20NAO4Kids


Status
------
Alpha version. All NAO commands are actually "say" replacements (for security and testing). 
Currently a Netbeans project, but a pom will be added.

We are waiting for some Scratch bugs/ideas to be fixed: (blocking extension commands).
